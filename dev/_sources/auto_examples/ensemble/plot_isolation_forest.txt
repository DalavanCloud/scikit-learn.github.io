IsolationForest example
==========================================

An example using IsolationForest for anomaly detection.

IsolationForest consists in 'isolating' the observations by randomly selecting
a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and
minimum values of the selected feature.

Since recursive partitioning can be represented by a tree structure, the
number of splitting required to isolate a sample is equivalent to the path
length from the root node to a terminating node.

This path length, averaged among a forest of such random trees, is a measure
of abnormality and our decision function.

Indeed random partitioning produces noticeable shorter paths for anomalies.
Hence, when a forest of random trees collectively produce shorter path lengths
for some particular samples, then they are highly likely to be anomalies.
