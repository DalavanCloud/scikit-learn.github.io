=======================================================
HuberRegressor vs Ridge on dataset with strong outliers
=======================================================

Fit Ridge and HuberRegressor on a dataset with outliers.

The example shows that the predictions in ridge are strongly influenced
by the outliers present in the dataset. The Huber regressor is less
influenced by the outliers since the model uses the linear loss for these.
As the parameter epsilon is increased for the Huber regressor, the decision
function approaches that of the ridge.
