GMM covariances
===============

Demonstration of several covariances types for Gaussian mixture models.

See :ref:`gmm` for more information on the estimator.

Although GMM are often used for clustering, we can compare the obtained
clusters with the actual classes from the dataset. We initialize the means
of the Gaussians with the means of the classes from the training set to make
this comparison valid.

We plot predicted labels on both training and held out test data using a
variety of GMM covariance types on the iris dataset.
We compare GMMs with spherical, diagonal, full, and tied covariance
matrices in increasing order of performance. Although one would
expect full covariance to perform best in general, it is prone to
overfitting on small datasets and does not generalize well to held out
test data.

On the plots, train data is shown as dots, while test data is shown as
crosses. The iris dataset is four-dimensional. Only the first two
dimensions are shown here, and thus some points are separated in other
dimensions.
